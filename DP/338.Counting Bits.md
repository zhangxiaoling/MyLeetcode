题目描述
--------
Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.
```
Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: [0,1,1]
```
```
Example 2:

Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]

Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?

Space complexity should be O(n).

Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.

题目思路
--------
考虑二进制数的规律。[000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111]，分别对应[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]。从上述二进制数可以看出来，4-7的二进制数既是对0-3的二进制数的最高位从0变成1，也就是说后面的二进制数都是在之前所有二进制的最高位加一位1。

1是0加1得来

2,3是0,1加1得来

4,5,6,7是0,1,2,3加1得来


题目代码
--------
```
class Solution(object):
    def countBits(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        list1=[0]
        while len(list1)<=num:
            list2=[i+1 for i in list1]
            list1=list1+list2
        return list1[:num+1]
```
