题目描述
---------
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]

Output: 5

Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]

Output: 0

Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

题目思路
--------

题目大意为只能由一次交易，并且卖出要在买入之后，最简单的方法就是遍历两次找出最大值，复杂度为O(n^2)，超时。

复杂度为O(n)：

对数组以卖出价格为变量进行遍历，通过比较当前价格和之前的最小值，找到当前的最小值，作为最可能的买入价格，
并求出在此情况下，以当前价格为卖出价格的最大利润值，与之前的全局最大值相比较，得到当前的全局最大利润值。


题目代码
--------
```
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(prices)<2:
            return 0
        profit=0
        minprice=prices[0]
        for i in prices:
            minprice=min(i,minprice)
            profit=max(i-minprice,profit)
        return profit
```
