题目描述
--------

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

begin to intersect at node c1.

```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). 
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. 
There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

```
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. 
There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_3.png)

```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. 
Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

Notes:

If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

题目思路
---------
1.不知道链表是否等长，所以第一步求链表长度，然后比较。

2.比较之后得到链表的长度差，考虑到交集点之后肯定是等长的，所以让较长的链表先向前跳长度差那么多步。

3.然后就可以对两个链表逐点比较，相等即返回。

4.当然，如果遍历到表尾还没有找到交点就返回NULL。

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
        """
        :type head1, head1: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        curA,curB=headA,headB
        lenA,lenB=0,0
        while curA!=None:
            lenA+=1
            curA=curA.next
        while curB!=None:
            lenB+=1
            curB=curB.next

        curA,curB=headA,headB
        if lenA>lenB:
            for i in range(lenA-lenB):
                curA=curA.next
        elif lenB>lenA:
            for i in range(lenB-lenA):
                curB=curB.next
        while curA!=curB:
            curA=curA.next
            curB=curB.next
        return curA
```
