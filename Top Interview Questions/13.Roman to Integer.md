题目描述
---------

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```
For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
```
I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.
```
Example 1:
```
Input: "III"
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "IV"
Output: 4
```
Example 3:
```
Input: "IX"
Output: 9
```
Example 4:
```
Input: "LVIII"
Output: 58
```
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
Example 5:
```
Input: "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
```
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

题目思路
-------

（1）建立一个dict，把罗马字母和整数一一对应的进行映射。具体的情况题目已经给出。

（2）对于题目中提到的特殊情况，单独进行处理，将字符串中特殊的罗马字母进行转换（replace），转换成计算规则一致的情况，特殊情况题目也已经给出。

（3）依次遍历字符串中的每个罗马字母，找到其在dict中对应的整数并相加，得到罗马字符到整数的转换。


题目代码

```
class Solution(object):
    def romanToInt(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        translation={
            'I':1,
            'V':5,
            'X':10,
            'L':50,
            'C':100,
            'D':500,
            'M':1000
        }
        
        s=s.replace("IV","IIII")
        s=s.replace("IX","VIIII")
        s=s.replace("XL","XXXX")
        s=s.replace("XC","LXXXX")
        s=s.replace("CD","CCCC")
        s=s.replace("CM","DCCCC")
        
        number=0
        for i in s:
            number+=translation[i]
            
        return number
 ```
