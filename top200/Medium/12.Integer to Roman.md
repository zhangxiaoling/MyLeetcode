题目描述
-------

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

```
For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

```
I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
```

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

Example 1:
```
Input: 3
Output: "III"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 4
Output: "IV"
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 9
Output: "IX"
```
Example 4:
```
Input: 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
```
Example 5:
```
Input: 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```


题目思路
-------

首先，建立一个阿拉伯整数与其罗马数表示的对应表；

然后，由于num在1——3999之间，因此可以从1000，100，10，1的量级去得到对应的位数。在1到9范围内。

最后，分类讨论几种情况：为9，为4，大于等于五，其余情况。

```
class Solution(object):
    def intToRoman(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        s=1000
        res=""
        
        dict={1:"I",5:"V",10:"X",50:"L",100:"C",500:"D",1000:"M"}
        
        while num!=0:
            r=num//s
            num=num%s
            
            if r==9:
                res+=dict[s]+dict[s*10]
            elif r==4:
                res+=dict[s]+dict[s*5]
            elif r>=5:
                res+=dict[s*5]+dict[s]*(r-5)
            else:
                res+=dict[s]*r
            
            s=s//10
        return res
```
